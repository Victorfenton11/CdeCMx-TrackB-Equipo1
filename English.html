                        <p>In order to unify the regions of the country by infections and recovered cases, we used two
                        techniques: principal component analysis (PCA) and the use of Machine Learning to see which
                        group or cluster each state belonged to. For this, we used the elbow curve method, which consists of
                        the sum of squared errors in each group for all the data we need, measuring the distance by using
                        an Euclidean metric, and looking for the point in which a curve or an "elbow" is drawn. That
                        point determines how many clusters we should use.</p>

                    According to Dr. Michele Torok, an epidemic curve is a graphic representation of the number of

                    Regarding the cases of a disease, they are very similar, since an outbreak is a disease that appears
                    where it is not common for it to appear, while an epidemic is a disease that attacks a certain
                    number of people in a certain time.

                    <p>Mexico as a developing country has been one of the most affected by the pandemic, the
                            population has been exposed to unprecedented stress, economic difficulties increased to those
                            already suffered before the pandemic, fear of an unknown virus and uncertainty of the health
                            system, all this has contributed to the gradual increase in the individual risk portfolio to present
                            psychological alterations; Although mental health is not among the first bases for society, it is of
                            the utmost importance to carry out preventive measures for them.
                    <br><br>
                    A clear example is anxiety, which is a conduct disorder characterized by increased muscle tension
                    and autonomous hyperactivity, negatively affecting the psychosocial functioning of the individual
                    almost daily; the exact cause is uncertain but is associated with the stress of emotional loss and
                    dangerous situations.

                    It occurs rarely before adolescence; the prevalence in the adolescent population is 0.9%, among
                    adults 2.9%, that is, 3 times higher than in adolescents (in the United States), now it is twice more
                    common in women than in men, white populations have more likely to be affected than those of
                    African, Asian or Hispanic ethnicity, although it must be taken into account that all these factors
                    were increased by the quarantine. (Gennaro, 2020) </p>

                        <strong>Example: Estado de México.-</strong> <br><br>
                        Attack ratio = [exposed population (3,850)] / total recovered cases (9,167)] x 100 = 42%. Thus, the

                            Spread throughout the world, the Coronavirus pandemic further increases the number of infected
                            cases and deceased people, also affecting our country. Its consequences have extrapolated the
                            health field, causing transformations in interpersonal relationships, daily life. politically and
                            psychologically.
                    <br><br>
                    “A major consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic is that it is likely to have increased social isolation
                    and loneliness (as reflected in our surveys), which are strongly associated with anxiety, depression,
                    self-harm, and suicide attempts throughout life's course. We can assume that for the general
                    population it has been a rather complex experience due to the fact that confinement tends to be
                    difficult since there are negative elements such as fear and anxiety.
                    <br><br>
                    Speaking of other types of repercussions, sectors within the Mexican economy begin to see
                    deterioration from the first months of the pandemic, the data shows that the fall in employment,
                    in tax collection and in company profits will lead to the beginning of a rapid and deep economic
                    crisis; Adding to this the forecast of job losses for this year in Mexico, according to business
                    associations and the international recruitment organization Manpower Group, 1.2 to 2 million jobs
                    have been lost. Also, it is worth mentioning that it was announced that the impact of the
                    coronavirus pandemic will cause the worst crisis that Latin America has suffered since 1914 and
                    1930, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) estimates that the
                    Mexican economy will be between the most affected, with a drop of 6.5% in GDP at the end of this
                    year.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, the coronavirus is instantly changing the way education is delivered, since the school and the
                    home have become the same place after the necessary regulations. According to UNESCO, more
                    than 861.7 million children and young people in 119 countries have been affected by having to
                    face the global pandemic that has hit us this year. Millions of families in the US have had to join
                    the 1.7 million children who are enrolled in homeschooling. As in Mexico, where the Ministry of
                    Public Education (SEP) has extended the vacation period from March 23 to April 17, 2020.
                    <br><br>
                    At this stage of the pandemic, no one doubts the direct and indirect psychological and social
                    effects of the disease in the majority of the population and that is why preventive measures
                    should be taken against it, in this article we have seen an approximation of how it can affect a
                    single mental appearance, but there are endless mental illnesses that affect the population on a
                    daily basis. It is necessary to keep in mind the attitudes and activities that we can take to prevent
                    them, among them is listening to music and new genres, discovering virtual galleries and museums
                    in Google Culture and Arts until learning completely new skills such as a new language or playing
                    an instrument Following established routines and trying to do new things or things that can keep
                    our mind occupied are also helpful. It should be noted that the hardest step when dealing with
                    mental health problems is asking for help and admitting that you have a problem. No matter how
                    much we try to give our mind the best care, there is a probability of falling into anxiety due to the
                    various repercussions that the pandemic can have; That's why we highly recommend the following
                    options for asking for help in the event of a mental health emergency: </p>
